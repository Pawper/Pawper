### Hello World, it's Phillip! 👋🌎

I've lived in Silicon Valley for nearly a decade, learning and working my way into tech.

* 🔍 I work with **Excel**, **PowerShell**, **Git** and **SQL** nearly every day at my current job
* 🙋‍♂️ I'm seeking to switch careers to **web development** 
* 👨‍💻 Over the past several years, I've been studying **Bash scripting**, **HTML**, **CSS/SCSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python** and **IT stuff** in my free time 
* 😌 I find myself really satisfied using **WSL**, **VS Code** & the **GitHub CLI** on my Surface Book 3. I guess Microsoft's got it going on? 🤔
* 😱 Oh no, I also have an Xbox One X with Gamepass 🎮
